# cellGMM
A Gaussian mixture model for cellwise outlier detection that can also handle missing at random values. The cellGMM model is estimated using an Expectation-Maximization type algorithm, which includes a concentration step (C-step) for detecting contaminated cells. Missing data and contaminated cells are imputed in the E-step.
